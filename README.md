# expense-shell
This repo contains the automation of expense project using bash scripting

Golden Rules to be followed when automating the manual process
    1) Code should be DRY 
    2) Logs should not be displayed on the screen
    3) It should always show whether the step is succesful or not 
    4) When you rerun the script from the second time on the same server, it should be qualified.
